**Naturalist, biologist, biodiversity data scientist**

I am a PhD student in the [Spribille Lab at the University of Alberta](https://spribillelab.wordpress.com). Currently, my research takes place in ᐊᒥᐢᑿᒌᐚᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᐣ / Amiskwacîwâskahikan / Edmonton, Treaty 6 territories (northern central Alberta), and within the territories of the *pune’luxutth’*, *quw’utsun’*, *snuneymuhw*, *leey’qsun*, *shts’um’inus*, *tla'amin*, *tsawwassen*, *lekwungen*, *lhaq'temish*, and *W̱SÁNEĆ* nations (southern coastal British Columbia).

My investigations harness a wide variety of data and techniques to analyse drivers of biodiversity change at multiple scales, from cells to ecosystems. Toward this end, I study a great diversity of organisms, linking ecological theory with field studies and experiments to improve understanding of the trait-environment relationships that underly niche dynamics in space and time. 

Presently, my work focuses on the fascinating worlds of lichens, in effort to better understand the physiological dynamics of "symbioses under stress." 
 
As an advocate for community science, I also have a special interest in the development of frameworks supporting a networked, community-based approach to biodiversity research and monitoring. This work began with the [Biodiversity Galiano project](http://biogaliano.org) and continues through the organization I co-founded with friends and colleagues: the [Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea (IMERSS).](http://imerss.org)
