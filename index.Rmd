**Naturalist, ecologist, biodiversity data scientist**

I am a PhD student in the [Spribille Lab at the University of Alberta](https://spribillelab.wordpress.com), with a life and research based in the southern Gulf Islands of the Salish Sea, within the shared, unceded, and asserted territories of the *pune’luxutth’*, *quw’utsun’*, *snuneymuhw*, *leey’qsun*, *shts’um’inus*, *tla'amin*, *tsawwassen*, *lekwungen*, *lhaq'temish*, and *W̱SÁNEĆ* nations, as well as the Indigenous families who have been stewards of these lands and waters since time immemorial.

My research draws on historical collections, field studies, and crowd-sourced biodiversity data, combined with environmental monitoring and remote sensing techniques, to analyse drivers of biodiversity change at multiple scales. I study a wide variety of organisms, linking ecological theory with observational studies to improve understanding of the trait-environment relationships underlying niche dynamics in space and time.
 
As an advocate for community science, I have a special interest in the development of frameworks supporting a networked, community-based approach to biodiversity research and monitoring. This work began with the [Biodiversity Galiano project](http://biogaliano.org) and continues through the organization I co-founded with friends and colleagues: the [Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea (IMERSS).](http://imerss.org)
