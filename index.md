# Andrew D.F. Simon

**Naturalist, ecologist, biodiversity data scientist**

My research draws on historical collections, field studies, and crowd-sourced biodiversity data, combined with environmental monitoring and remote sensing techniques, to analyse drivers of biodiversity change at multiple scales. I study a wide variety of organisms, linking ecological theory with observational studies to improve our understanding of the trait-environment relationships underlying niche dynamics in space and time.
 
As an advocate for community science, I have a special interest in the development of frameworks supporting a networked approach to biodiversity research and monitoring. This work began with the [Biodiversity Galiano project](http://biogaliano.org) and continues through the organization I co-founded with friends and colleagues: the [Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea.](http://imerss.org)
